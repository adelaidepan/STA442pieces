First state the null hypothesis:
$H_0 : \mu_{verbal} = \mu_{math}$ which means $\mu_{diff} = 0$

Check the difference in means before start testing to get a rough idea:

```
> mean(sat$VERBAL)-mean(sat$MATH)
[1] -53.875
```
The difference is -53.875, we might be able to reject $H_0$.

Now derive the difference between verbal and math:

```
sat$diff <- sat$VERBAL - sat$MATH
```

Check if the distribution of the difference is normal:

```
boxplot(sat$diff)
qqnorm(sat$diff)
qqline(sat$diff)
```
